GlusterFS on DigitalOcean
=========================

Requirements & Setup
------------

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file like this one:

```bash
#This can be found on https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api
digitalocean_token = ""

region = "NYC2"

size = "8GB"
#This script always creates at least two nodes; use a value higher than 0 if you wish to initialize with more than a single replica.
peer_count = "3"

#Path to your Private Key
ssh_pvt_key = "do-key"
#Path to your Public key
ssh_pub_key = "./do-key.pub"

ssh_key_fingerprint = ""
```

You can generate a keypair for use above using:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ./do-key
```
and get the fingerprint:

```bash
ssh-keygen -lf do-key.pub | awk '{print $2}'
```
or run it on the path to your existing public keypair.

Deploying
---------

Once your `tfvars` file or all environmental variables are ready, just run:

```bash
terraform apply
```
in your repo directory. Once completed, you'll see some additional connection data at the end:

* Your Client IP address.
* Your GlusterFS Mountpoint on your Client.
* Some additional, totally optional (but recommended) security stuff.

Environment
-----------

This script creates:

* A single pair of GlusterFS nodes (2 droplets); you can set the `peer_count` variable to add any additional servers to the cluster
* A single storage volume for the cluster
* A single client server where it is mounted

You can verify the cluster is up and running using:

```bash
gluster volume info
```
and

```bash
gluster peer status
```

Your data, on the client, will be accessible to the volume mounted on `/mnt/gluster`

Security
--------

It is recommended that, after you've confirmed you can access the client and it can access the cluster, that you run, on any of the storage nodes (not the client):

```bash
gluster volume set volume1 auth.allow <CLIENT DROPLET IP ADDRESS>
```
You can also allow any other public IP addresses you would like to add to the access list (for example, any application servers that may require access to your storage cluster, etc.)
